SudoPdf enables you to generate PDFs dynamically on-the-fly. Basically we stich the data to the template you created on our platform. 

Alternatively you can also use your publically available webpage or html code to generate a PDF. 



This guide will walk you through the process of getting started with SudoPdf.

## 1. Create an account

First, you need to create an account on SudoPdf. You can do this by clicking the "Sign Up" button in the top right corner of the screen.

## 2. Setup a template 

After you have created an account, you need to setup a template. You can do this by clicking the "Create Template" button on our templates page. 

You will be provided with rendering modes to choose from. By default, you can go with the basic model. 

Once you choose the rendering model, you will be redirected to the created template that has source code on left and preview on right. 

You can edit the source code to your liking and save it. 

You can choose sample data to fill the template and preview the PDF. You can access that through global variable `$data`. On production, the data will be replaced with the actual data you provide. 


You can also use libraries like `lodash`, `victory`, `dayjs`, `qrcode`, `chartjs` to be included in the template.

You can also include images as image tag with image url. 

## 3. Generate PDF

You can use the `POST /pdf/generate` endpoint to generate a PDF. You have to provide the template id and data to generate the PDF. There are also options to include url, html, metadata, and render options. You can refer to the [API Reference](https://app.sudopdf.com/api-reference/endpoint/generate-pdf) for more details.

You can choose between sync and async mode. Sync mode will return the PDF immediately and async mode will return a job id. If you are using async mode(which we recommend), you can know the coompletion webhook status by subscribing to the webhook in our webhook section of our app. You can have N number of webhooks and we have a strong retry mechanism to ensure webhook is delivered. 

We are on the process of building a SDK for different languages to make it easier to use the API. Contact us at [sales@sudopdf.com](mailto:sales@sudopdf.com) for SDK on your favorite language on request and future commitment.

## Authentication


Please generate a `API Key` in the [application](https://app.sudopdf.com/settings/api-keys) to use the API. 

These `API Key` are used to authenticate the requests to the API and should be appended to the request header as `Authorization: Bearer <API Key>`.



# SDK

We have a SDK for Typescript/javascript for now and its the most recommended way to use the API. 
It is a library that wraps the API and provides a simple interface to use the API. Its also type-safe and can save your time on tinkering. 


```typescript
import { SudoPdf } from "@sudopdf/sdk";

const sudoPdf = new SudoPdf({
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
});

const pdf = await sudoPdf.generatePdf({
  templateId: "your-template-id",
  data: {
    name: "John Doe",
    email: "john.doe@example.com",
  },
  async: true,
  filename: "your-filename.pdf",
  webhook: "https://your-webhook-url",
  webhookSecret: "your-webhook-secret",

});
```
