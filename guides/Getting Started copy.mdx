SudoPdf is a platform that allows you to generate PDFs from HTML, URLs, or templates with powerful rendering options and webhook support.

This guide will walk you through the process of getting started with SudoPdf.

## 1. Create an account

First, you need to create an account on SudoPdf. You can do this by clicking the "Sign Up" button in the top right corner of the screen.

## 2. Setup a template 

After you have created an account, you need to setup a template. You can do this by clicking the "Create Template" button on our





## Authentication


Please generate a `API Key` in the [application](https://app.sudopdf.com/settings/api-keys) to use the API. 

These `API Key` are used to authenticate the requests to the API and should be appended to the request header as `Authorization: Bearer <API Key>`.



# SDK

We have a SDK for Typescript/javascript for now and its the most recommended way to use the API. 
It is a library that wraps the API and provides a simple interface to use the API. Its also type-safe and can save your time on tinkering. 


```typescript
import { SudoPdf } from "@sudopdf/sdk";

const sudoPdf = new SudoPdf({
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
});

const pdf = await sudoPdf.generatePdf({
  templateId: "your-template-id",
  data: {
    name: "John Doe",
    email: "john.doe@example.com",
  },
  async: true,
  filename: "your-filename.pdf",
  webhook: "https://your-webhook-url",
  webhookSecret: "your-webhook-secret",

});
```
