This guide will walk you through the process of getting started with SudoPdf.

## 1. Create an account

First, you need to create an account on SudoPdf. You can do this by clicking the "Sign Up" button in the top right corner of the screen.

## 2. Setup a template 

After you have created an account, you need to setup a template. You can do this by clicking the "Create Template" button on our templates page. 

You will be provided with rendering modes to choose from. By default, you can go with the basic model. 

Once you choose the rendering model, you will be redirected to the created template 






## Authentication


Please generate a `API Key` in the [application](https://app.sudopdf.com/settings/api-keys) to use the API. 

These `API Key` are used to authenticate the requests to the API and should be appended to the request header as `Authorization: Bearer <API Key>`.



# SDK

We have a SDK for Typescript/javascript for now and its the most recommended way to use the API. 
It is a library that wraps the API and provides a simple interface to use the API. Its also type-safe and can save your time on tinkering. 


```typescript
import { SudoPdf } from "@sudopdf/sdk";

const sudoPdf = new SudoPdf({
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
});

const pdf = await sudoPdf.generatePdf({
  templateId: "your-template-id",
  data: {
    name: "John Doe",
    email: "john.doe@example.com",
  },
  async: true,
  filename: "your-filename.pdf",
  webhook: "https://your-webhook-url",
  webhookSecret: "your-webhook-secret",

});
```

 Please contact us at [sales@sudopdf.com](mailto:sales@sudopdf.com) for SDK on your favorite language on request and future commitment.
