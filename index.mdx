## Authentication


Please generate a `API Key` in the [application](https://app.sudopdf.com/settings/api-keys) to use the API. 

These `API Key` are used to authenticate the requests to the API and should be appended to the request header as `Authorization: Bearer <API Key>`.



# Installing SDK

```bash
npm install @sudopdf/sdk
```

We have a SDK for Typescript/javascript for now and its the most recommended way to use the API. 
It is a library that wraps the API and provides a simple interface to use the API. Its also type-safe and can save your time on tinkering.
